  #### Open your terminal and run the following git clone command to copy the repository to your local machine.
  #### Replace *repository-url* with the URL of your forked repository.
  ```
  git clone <repository-url>
```


# üõ†Ô∏è Start working on your project
#### Begin building your solution! Collaborate with your teammates and push changes regularly.

# üìù Commit Your Changes
#### Track and save your progress using Git:
#### Check the status of your changes
   ```
    git status
 ```
  

  #### Use the git add command to stage the changes you want to commit
  ```
    git add .
 ```
      
  #### Commit with a meaningful message
  #### *Option 1* : Simple Commit Format (Beginner Friendly)
  #### Use this if you're new to Git
   ```
    git commit -m "Your descriptive commit message"
 ```
#### *Option 2* : Conventional Commits (Recommended)
#### Follow this format for more structured, professional commit history  
```
git commit -m "<type>(<scope>): <subject>"
```
| Type | Purpose |
|----------|----------|
| feat    | for a new feature for the user, not a new feature for build script. Such commit will trigger a release bumping a MINOR version    |
| fix    | for a bug fix for the user, not a fix to a build script. Such commit will trigger a release bumping a PATCH version     |
| perf    | for performance improvements. Such commit will trigger a release bumping a PATCH version    |
| docs    | for changes to the documentation     |
| test | for adding missing tests, refactoring tests; no production code change  |
| style  | for formatting changes, missing semicolons, etc  |
| refactor | for refactoring production code, e.g. renaming a variable  |
| build | for updating build configuration, development tools or other changes irrelevant to the user|

#### Scope: Area of change (e.g., api, ui, auth)
#### Subject: One-line summary in present tense, no period at the end

```
Example: git commit -m "fix(button): fix submit button not working"
```

# üöÄ Push Your Changes
  #### Send your local commits to GitHub:
  ```
    git push origin
 ```
# üß† Tips
#### *Commit often* : Small, frequent commits help track progress and fix bugs easily.
#### *Write clear messages* : Describe what you did in each commit.
#### *Collaborate* : Make sure everyone in your team contributes.
